              <strong>CHARTER STATEMENT </strong> <br />
              <strong> </strong> <br />
Develop the Mid-Michigan Community Non-Motorized  Pathway starting with the segment from Ithaca through Clare, promoting  partnerships with communities, businesses and governments in the area.   <br />
<strong> </strong> <br />
<strong> </strong> <br />
<strong>Long-Term Goal: </strong> <br />
Have a separate non-motorized pathway providing a  quality non-motorized environment for all through safety, health, education,  culture and art.  Provide linkage to  businesses and communities through other routes, including regional tracks. <br />
 <br />
<strong>Purpose: </strong> <br />
Create the Mid-Michigan Community Non-Motorized  Pathway for the benefit of the public residents, communities and governments in  the area of the path.  Elements of the  path include: <br />
  Separate  non-motorized path <br />
  Connection  to the communities <br />
  Quality  family experience <br />
  Link to  public parking (park &amp; ride, bike) lots <br />
  Promote  art and cultures <br />
  Support  education <br />
  Provide  a low-stress quality experience <br />
  Link to  major trails <br />
  Low  impact environmentally and socially </p>
            <p> <br />
              <strong>Task:</strong> <br />
              Identify  long-term corridors for a separated path.   <br />
              Encourage  short-term solutions and local connections.   Support business and communities to promote a quality experience.   <br />
              Recognize  opportunities for community loops to encourage positive education and cultural  experience.   <br />
              Identify  funding options for path development and connectivity to encourage a greener  lifestyle.   <br />
              Promote  fund raising events for the public and path maintenance.  Develop the path for cyclists, pedestrians  and rollerbladers.   <br />
              Include  provisions for handicap users. </p>
            <p> <br />
              <strong>Success: </strong> <br />
              In 20 years, develop a separated pathway connecting  Mid-Michigan communities starting with Ithaca through Clare.  Include linkage to regional paths such as the  Fred Meijer and the Pere Marquette trails.   Support communities in connecting the non-motorized system to get  individuals to local destinations, creating without use of motorized vehicles,  a quality family experience.  Have in  place a funding mechanism to provide maintenance for the next 20 years.  Have evidence of a healthier more sustainable  community, both physically and economically.   </p>
