        	<h1>FAQ</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 align="left">Where is it being installed? </h3>
          <p align="left"><br />
            When Community leaders got together to propose a route  for this separated pathway their first step was to look at abandoned rails, or  along side active rails. Unfortunately, the Mid Michigan area has no usable  rail lines.<br />
            The  next best option was to look at federal highways. As Old US Highway 27 and US  127 both have 100ft right-of-ways (50ft on each side), this was the next  obvious location for a non-motorized pathway</p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>Who will use the Pathway? </h3>
          <p><br />
          </p>
          <p>This  pathway will be utilized by; bicyclists, walkers, runners, handicap users, and  rollerbladers in the warmer months with cross country skiers utilizing the  pathway in the winter months. Families, individuals, young and old will all  have access to this trail for recreation and comminuting needs. By  incorporating art in this pathway it will also be an economic draw for tourism  to our area.</p>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What about Crime and Vandalism?</h3>
          <p><br />
            Non-Motorized  pathways throughout the Country have reported lower crime, vandalism, and  littering rates in areas after trails are installed.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>What about Liability and insurance?</h3>
          <p><br />
            The Mid MI Community Pathways group will be covering an  insurance policy on the trail. Adjacent property owners are protected by  Michigan Public Acts 26 and 27, from liability for injuries to persons that  stray onto their property from a public trail (except in cased of gross  negligence).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">What is  it made of?</h3>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">Ideally this trail  will be a separated non-motorized paved pathway. The pathway will be a 10ft  wide paved pathway, with 2ft of crushed gravel on either side of the trail. It  may be necessary to begin the process with a gravel pathway, until further  funding is available to allow for a paved pathway.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>Who will pay for the Pathway? </h3>
          <p><br />
            Construction  funds will be coming from various grants and individual donations. Maintenance  funds will come from user fees, private donations, grants, and the sale of  various art installations located throughout the trail system.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>Will my taxes increase?</h3>
          <p><br />
            No. The pathway will not use any funding from local  taxes. The pathway has no legal authority to tax and never can. The pathway  will use Federal and State grants set aside for similar projects.  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>What about my trees?</h3>
          <p><br />
            We will make every attempt to disrupt as few trees, and  shrubs as possible. Part of the beauty and attraction of a path such as this is  the natural landscaping that already exists. As the budget allows more trees  and landscaping will be installed to add to the existing landscaping.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>What  will it do for local businesses?
          </h3>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Evidence  suggests that if business owners and entrepreneurs along the proposed pathway  take advantage of the opportunities provided that the rural communities could  benefit economically from trail-related activity.</p>
